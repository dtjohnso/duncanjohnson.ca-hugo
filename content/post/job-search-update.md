In a [previous post][job-search-again], I mentioned that I was transitioning out of my position at [Meadowlands][mbc].

Since then, I have accepted a full-time position at [Foundation Baptist College][fbc] as an administrator and member of the faculty, and I begin work in this new position on Monday.
