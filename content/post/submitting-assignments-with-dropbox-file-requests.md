For several of my classes, I've taken to using Dropbox's "File Request" feature for having students submit writing assignments. It's really easy for students to use:

1. Open the File Request link for your project
2. Drag and drop the file
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. I get the file instantly

**Note:** If you don't get an email confirmation from Dropbox, you didn't do it correctly (usually that means you forgot to click "Submit"). In that case, just try again.

Here's a quick (7 seconds) video demo:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//VDl9jJbxO9o?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
