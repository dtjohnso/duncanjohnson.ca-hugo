This summer I will be in British Columbia and North Carolina to speak. I will be at [Grace Baptist Church of Victoria][gbcvic] July 6--12. I'll speak in the church services that Sunday, and then during the week I'll be offering my Th105 Church History Survey course as a block class throughout the week. Then, on July 27, I'll be at [Faith Baptist Church (Linville, NC)][fbc-linville] during the Sunday services. I'll be giving three sessions on the area of Baptist history.
