Since last October, I've been employed at [Meadowlands Baptist Church][meadowlands] in a staff role as the Church Administrator. Because of changing needs at the church, my position has come to an end and I am back on the job market again.

My [resume](/resume/) is available in a variety of formats, and I'm interested in talking to people about employment opportunities.

*[Edit Aug 2,2013]:* Several people have asked if I'm considering relocation. My intention is to remain in Edmonton where I continue to teach at [Foundation Baptist College][fbc].
