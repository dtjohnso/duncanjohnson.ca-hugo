Every now and then, you hear somebody preach a sermon that really sticks in your memory. For me, this happened when I heard [this sermon][sermon] by Brent Cook in chapel at Bob Jones University. The message takes 1 Cor. 1:18 as its foundational text:

> For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are
> perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
> (1Â Corinthians 1:18 NKJ)

I replayed this sermon for my students in my class on evangelism a year later (the link above goes to the website for that course), and I've listened to this message many times since. It came to mind again today as I was studying 2 Cor. 2:12--3:18.
