I am looking forward to attending the annual conference for the Andrew Fuller Center for Baptist Studies this year on "George Whitefield and the Great Awakening."

Here is the introduction from the [conference website][event-page]:

> George Whitefield was not only the most celebrated preacher of the eighteenth century, but he was also a central figure in the creation of modern Evangelicalism. His emphasis on the new birth, his passion for evangelism, his ability to cross denominational boundaries and build networks of Christians based on the gospel and Reformation convictions were central features in what we know today as Evangelicalism. In this conference celebrating the tercentennial (1714) birth of Whitefield, we will explore these key themes of this remarkable Christian’s life and what they meant for his day and mean for ours.

Here are the session titles, taken from the [tentative schedule posted on the AFCBS blog][afcbs-blog]:

> Session 1: "The Calvinism of George Whitefield" (Thomas S. Kidd)  
> Session 2: "George Whitefield: Anglican evangelist" (Lee Gatiss)  
> Session 3: "George Whitefield & the Wesleys" (Stephen Nichols)  
> Session 4: "Preaching George Whitefield" (Steve Lawson)  
> Session 5: "The Spirituality of George Whitefield" (Bruce Hindmarsh)  
> Session 6: "Whitefield’s preaching and the politics of Empire" (Jerome Mahaffey)  
> Session 7: "The Legacy of George Whitefield" (David Bebbington)  
> Session 8: "The Hymnody of the Great Awakening" (Esther Crookshank)

As another neat bonus, a few days ago I received my copy of Thomas Kidd's new biography titled *George Whitefield: America’s Spiritual Founding Father* (ISBN 9780300181623). I'm looking forward to digging into this book over the next few days. The hardcover is available from [Amazon][amazon] and [CBD][cbd], and there is also a [Kindle version][kindle] available.
