Next week I'll be speaking about the Protestant Reformation at [Foundation Baptist Church](http://foundationbaptistchurch.com/) in Calgary. Below is some promotional information about the sessions. More information will be available on the [conference website](http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/calgary-reformation-conference/), where you can sign up for email updates.

Nearly 500 years ago, the events of the Protestant Reformation upended the western world. Our pursuit of God today is greatly helped by the rediscoveries of the Reformers. Because our doctrine depends on the discoveries of faithful men and women in the past, we need to know our family history. Come to our Fall Conference on the Reformation for an encouraging and edifying look at what those turbulent times of the past mean for us today. <!-- more -->

**Speaker**

Duncan Johnson (M.Div., Bob Jones University, 2011) teaches courses on Bible, theology, and church history at Foundation Baptist College in Edmonton. One of his passions is to show believers today how their faith connects through past generations with the apostolic teachings of the Scripture itself.
