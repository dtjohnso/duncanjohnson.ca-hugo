Today I am making available a project that I've only recently begun. This project had its genesis a few years back when I created a [timeline of events relevant to the Old Testament book of Isaiah](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Isaiah-Visualizations/). 

Last week, I took that work and expanded it into something I've had in mind for a while---a more comprehensive [timeline of the history of Israel](http://duncanjohnson.ca/OT-Timeline/). Right now, this only covers Old Testament Israel from the reign of Saul to the post-exilic period, and the details are sparse in some periods and heavy in others (esp. during the period of Isaiah's life). There are many more things I'd like to do with this later, but I thought I'd make what I have so far available, especially since it's relevant to the class I'm teaching right now on the Old Testament Historical Books.
