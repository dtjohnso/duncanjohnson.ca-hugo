*This post is intended as a follow-up to [my prior post][english-bible-1] on the history of the English Bible.*

Around the turn of the 19th century, a consensus began to develop that the archaic language of the KJV needed updating. At first, most efforts were focused on revising the existing English translations (usually focusing on the translations in the Tyndale/KJV tradition). In addition to these efforts, a growing market developed for fresh translations from the original text. 

A number of different factors combined to generate this interest in updated English translations. One reason for renewed interest in translation was the discovery of previously unknown manuscripts, such as Codex Sinaiticus in 1844[^2] and the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947.[^1] Discoveries like these fostered increased interest in identifying (as accurately as possible) the original wording of the Greek and Hebrew texts of Scripture. Later on in the twentieth century, differences in translation style also became a topic of debate. The inevitable result was the production of different translations that took one side or the other in these controversies. For the Bible-reading public, this had the effect of producing a somewhat confusing array of competing Bible versions. 

In the notes that follow, we will attempt to briefly describe the various issues at stake. Once these foundational issues have been explained, we'll proceed to a survey of the various English translations of the Bible that appeared after 1881. Because of the broad scope of these two general headings, these notes will be more descriptive than they will be analytical. Those who wish to gain more insight into the various topics addressed should consult some of the resources in the reading list at the end of the article.

## Foundational issues

In this section, we will attempt to provide a brief summary of the various issues that have been controversial in the recent history of the English Bible. Our goal here will be to simply define necessary terms and summarize contrasting viewpoints on the issues. Since many of these issues require knowledge of the original languages to be fully understood, we will not seek to "answer" or "settle" these questions here in any meaningful sense.

### Source Text: Impact of modern manuscript discoveries

As already mentioned, the late 19th century was an exciting time in the field of manuscript studies. Before we recount the discoveries of this period, however, we need to backtrack a few centuries and talk about the Greek manuscripts available to the translators of the KJV.

During the reign of Henry VIII in England, Erasmus produced the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament. His first edition was published in 1516, and he released four successive editions until 1535.
